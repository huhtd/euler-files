1. Euler Warm-up
    a) The module system is used to load modules such as gcc (~ module load gcc) onto euler. Each time you login, you need to load your required/desired modules to use.
        you can view modules with module list.
    
    b) LSF is a batch system by IBM, previously used on Euler. Since it is licsensed by core the cost has become unjustified and eth has switched to the 
        opensource slurm, an open-source batch system used by most HPC centres throughout the world â€” including CSCS in Lugano. Load Leveler is another batch system. 
        On the ETH HPC clusters, we use the SLURM batch system to manage computing jobs.
    
    c) from the examples on the hpc wiki we can see commands can be executed with sbatch --wrap"command" also with possible IO like with sbatch --wrap"./main.cpp > du.out"

    d)
